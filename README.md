## Project Structure 📁

All files are intended to be in the same main folder for the paths to work correctly.



**Note on Images:** You will need to add your own images. The `<img>` tag in each file has an empty `src=""`. To make it work, add your image name (e.g., `src="t-rex.jpg"`) and place the image file in the same folder.

## How to Use 🚀

1.  Create a new folder (e.g., "DinoDex").
2.  Save all 11 files (1 `index.html`, 1 `style.css`, and the 9 dinosaur `.html` files) inside this folder.
3.  (Optional) Add your 9 images to this same folder, making sure to update the `src=""` path in each dinosaur file.
4.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start.
