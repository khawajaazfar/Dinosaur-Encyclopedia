        <h2>About the Microraptor</h2>
        <p>Microraptor was a small, feathered dinosaur with wings on both its arms and legs, giving it a unique four-winged appearance. It is believed to have been capable of gliding between trees, making it one of the earliest known flying dinosaurs. Its sharp teeth and claws suggest it hunted small animals, insects, and possibly fish.</p>
