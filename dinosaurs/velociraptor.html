        <h2>About the Velociraptor</h2>
        <p>Despite popular depictions, the real Velociraptor was only about the size of a turkey. It was a feathered dinosaur with a long, stiff tail. Its most famous feature was a large, sickle-shaped claw on each foot, which it likely used to pin down and dispatch prey. They were intelligent and probably hunted in packs.</p>
