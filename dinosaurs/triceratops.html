        <h2>About the Triceratops</h2>
        <p>Triceratops, meaning "three-horned face," is one of the most recognizable dinosaurs. It had a large, bony frill at the back of its skull and three distinct horns. It likely used these horns and its frill for defense against predators like T-Rex, as well as for courtship displays.</p>
