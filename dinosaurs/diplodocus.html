        <h2>About the Diplodocus</h2>
        <p>Diplodocus is one of the most famous long-necked sauropods. It is known for its incredible length, a large portion of which was its long neck and even longer, whip-like tail. Unlike Brachiosaurus, its forelegs were shorter than its hind legs, meaning it likely grazed on low-lying ferns and vegetation rather than high treetops.</p>
