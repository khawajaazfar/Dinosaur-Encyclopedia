        <h2>About the Ankylosaurus</h2>
        <p>Often called a "living tank," the Ankylosaurus was covered in thick, bony plates of armor, called osteoderms. Its body was low and wide, and its head was heavily armored. Its most famous weapon was a massive, bony club at the end of its tail, which it could swing with enough force to break the bones of predators.</p>
