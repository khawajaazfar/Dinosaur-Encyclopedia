        <h2>About the Therizinosaurus</h2>
        <p>Therizinosaurus was a bizarre dinosaur with enormous scythe-like claws that could reach up to one meter in length. Despite its fearsome appearance, it is believed to have been mostly herbivorous, using its claws to pull down vegetation. Its long neck, pot-bellied body, and feathers made it one of the most unusual theropods ever discovered.</p>
